Divergence times in demosponges were analysed under the fossilized-birth-death model in BEAST 2.4.3. 

The files are organized in the following folders: **data**,**XML**,**precooked_runs**, **figures**.

The **data** folder includes the alignment as well as the sequences for all new mt genomes used in this paper.
The **XML** folder includes the xml file generated by BEAST BEAUTi to run BEAST. In addition we provide the shell skript for cluster analyses. The **precooked_runs** folder include all outputfiles of the run by means of log files which can be analysed in TRACER and raw .trees files. The **figure** folder contains a summary of outputfigures.
